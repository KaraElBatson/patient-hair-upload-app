# üì± Hair Photo Upload Experience ‚Äì Patient Journey Prototype (PRD)

## 1. Overview
This project aims to design and develop a **mobile prototype** that provides patients with the **most seamless and effortless experience** when uploading their **hair photos** for medical or consultation purposes.  
The focus is on **user-centered onboarding**, intuitive photo guidance, and a smooth step-by-step journey that minimizes confusion and friction.

- **Tech Stack:** React Native + TypeScript + Expo Go  
- **Platform:** iOS & Android  
- **Goal:** To simplify and enhance the patient photo submission process through a guided mobile interface.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Eliminate user confusion and friction in the photo upload process.
- Build an **intuitive onboarding flow** that explains purpose, steps, and privacy clearly.
- Ensure photos are uploaded with proper **lighting, angle, and framing guidance**.
- Provide a **secure and fast** upload process that integrates with the backend API or cloud storage.
- Prototype should simulate a **complete user journey** from onboarding ‚Üí photo upload ‚Üí confirmation.
